# Data-analytics-for-airpassengers-using-ML

## Overview 
This is an ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model integrated with a web-app to predict the changes in number of air-passengers. for eg: with 11 years of data from 2011 to 2022, the model will be able to predict till 2024 with an user friendly graph plot.

## The problem it solves 
Forecasting is a common data science practice which helps organisations to set their goals/plans. This model essentially helps airlines or aviation businesses in anomaly detection and/or setting goals according to the trend.

This is where you can select years for prediction, change the historical data with your `.csv` file for prediction and view the raw data

## Tech stack used 
- Python 
- Streamlit 
- FBProphet 
- Pandas 

## Running/testing the model 
The model is still in beta and training but it can still be aaccessed locally **A full fletched web app with multiple models and graphs will be made public soon!**
To test the model locally :
1. download this github repo
2. install all the dependencies from `requirements.txt`
3. run `model.py`
4. run `streamlit run model.py` in terminal 

## Changing historical data for prediction 
NOTE: The `.csv` should have two columns, 1 with the name `Month` ( which has all the dates ) and 2 with the name `#Passengers` ( which has all the number of passengers )

### Method 1
You can directly change the `.csv` from here

### Method 2
- download the file from github 
- change `AirPassengers.csv` with your `.csv` containing the historical data (the data should be in two columns with date and closing value)
- In the `df` variable change `AirPassengers.csv` with your path of the data 
- In `df_train = df[['Month','#Passengers']]` and `df_train = df_train.rename(columns={'Month':'ds','#Passengers':'y'})` swap "month" and "#passengers" with your two columns names
- run `model.py` 
- input `streamlit run model.py` in the terminal to start the localhost
