This is an ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model integrated with a web-app to predict the changes in number of air-passengers. for eg: with 11 years of data from 2011 to 2022, the model will be able to predict till 2024 with an user friendly graph plot.

## The problem it solves 
Forecasting is a common data science practice which helps organisations to set their goals/plans. This model essentially helps airlines or aviation businesses in anomaly detection and/or setting goals according to the trend.
